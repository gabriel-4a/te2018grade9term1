  contacts
  Object Array. Each object represents a contact. Contacts have four properties,
  and all property values are strings:
    -name: The contact's name. Can consist of any characters, spaces, etc.
    -number: The contact's 10-digit phone number (as a string).
    -email: The contact's email address.
    -notes: Any additional text relevant to the contact (e.g., "mobile number")

  quit
  Boolean. Represents if the program should continue running (true) or
  not (false).

  -Phone numbers must have a value greater than 0.

   length of an email address is greater than 0, it needs to be validated,
   so the criteria below apply.

  Compares the names of two contacts, a and b, to determine their alphabetical
  order. If a's name comes before b's, return -1. If a's name comes after b's,
  return 1. If a's name does not come before or after b's, then they must share
  the same name, in which case you should return 0.

  To compare strings alphabetically, you can use comparison operators, just as
  you would with numbers. For example, "c" < "d" is true, while "c" > "d" is
  false.

  Note that a and b are passed in as objects, so you should access their name
  properties before comparing. Also before comparing, you should convert both
  names to lowercase or uppercase. This will make the comparison ignore
  capitalization, which is important for comparing strings alphabetically.

  with those values, add the object to the global contacts array, and sort
  the array according to the compareContacts() function. Finally, let the user
  know that the contact was added successfully.

  You should get the user's input for name, number, and email by calling the
  getNameInput(), getNumberInput(), and getEmailInput() functions, respectively.
